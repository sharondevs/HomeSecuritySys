## Home Security System usign IoT with power optimization
This is my mini project on home security system, done using IoT devices. 


The need for security systems nowadays is a serious demand. As the number of crimes increasing abruptly, we seek help from the third eye- ‘security systems.’ Advancement in the field of security is improving day by day and as a result demands increases resulting in installation and maintenance cost increments. By understanding the need for security as well as to find an effective way to implement it by means of low cost and high efficiency resulted in our project. Investing our ideas and cascading them resulted in Security system using PIR and Laser.’ Simple technology but highly efficient one. ‘Basic password protected door lock system integrated with Laser and in addition to it we’ve introduced PIR (passive infrared sensor). By using PIR sensor we can detect the motion and human presence. By using this system we can save energy by almost more than half of the total energy required to run any other security systems.
